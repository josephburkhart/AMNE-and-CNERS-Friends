# AMNE and CNERS Friends
This group is for current and former students, staff, and faculty of UBC's Ancient Mediterranean and Near East department, formerly called the Classical, Near Eastern, and Religious Studies department. The purpose of this group is to provide an easy way for members to find digital copies of books, articles, and other materials for use in their research.

The group library contains references that have been submitted by group members and reviewed by group admins for quality control. Each reference has been given tags to indicate subject and methodology, with an additional tag to indicate who has a PDF file of the source.
To add your own references to this library, you must export them with attachments to Zotero RDF format and email the exported folder to Joseph Burkhart (group admin) at <insert email here> for quality control review. In order to pass review, each reference must meet the following criteria:

1. Bibliographic information must be properly formatted and include at minimum: 
    - Title 
      - Must include subtitle and follow anglophone punctuation and capitalization standards (First Letter of Most Words Capitalized; title separated from subtitle by ": ")
    - Creators (authors, editors, etc.)
      - Must include full first names, last names, and middle initials (when middle initials are given in the original source). First names must be complete, even if only first initials are given in the original source.
      - For chapters in edited volumes, the author of the chapter should be given alongside all editors of the volume.
    - Publisher
    - Place
    - Year
    - DOI (for all journal articles that have one)
    - URL (if source was originally found online)
    - Date Accessed (if source was originally found online)
    
    
2. Attached PDF must be legible and complete
