# AMNE and CNERS Friends
This group is for current and former students, staff, and faculty of UBC's Ancient Mediterranean and Near East department (AMNE), formerly called the Classical, Near Eastern, and Religious Studies department (CNERS). The purpose of this group is to provide an easy way for members to find digital copies of books, articles, and other materials for use in their research.

The group library contains references that have been submitted by group members and reviewed by group admins for quality control. Each reference has been given tags to indicate subject area and methodology, with an additional tag to indicate the name of a person who has a PDF file of the source. To obtain a PDF of a source, you can email the person who has it. See [here](<insert link here>) for a list of name tags and their associated emails.

To add your own references to this library, you must export them *with attachments* to Zotero RDF format, zip up the resulting folder, and email it to Joseph Burkhart (group admin) at <insert email here> for quality control review. In order to pass review, each reference must meet the following criteria:

1. Bibliographic information must be properly formatted and include at minimum: 
    - Title 
      - Must include subtitle and follow anglophone punctuation and capitalization standards (First Letter of Most Words Capitalized; title separated from subtitle by ": ")
    - Creators (authors, editors, etc.)
      - Must include full first and last names (and middle initials when they are given in the original source). **First names must be complete, even if only first initials are given in the original source**, so you may have to do some digging.
      - For chapters in edited volumes, the author of the chapter should be given alongside all editors of the volume.
    - Publisher
    - Place
    - Year
    - DOI (for all journal articles that have one)
    - URL (if source was originally found online)
    - Date Accessed (if source was originally found online)
    
2. Attached PDF must be readable and complete:
    - All pages must be included
        - For book chapters, please include the book's title page, bibliography, and endnotes for the chapter
    - For scanned PDFs, text must be legible (washed out or scribbled out is not ok)
    - DRM-controlled PDFs will not be accepted. These include PDFs which have an "expiration date" (e.g., on loan from Proquest) or which require a password to be opened. For assistance in removing DRM from PDFs, please contact the group admin.
    - Optional: scanned PDFs are much more useful if they have been OCR'ed, meaning that a computer has done text-recognition analysis and made the PDF searchable. For assistance in running OCR on your PDF, please contact the group admin.

3. All tags must be removed from the reference except for tags which indicate subject area and methodology (there can be multiple subject tags and multiple method tags). To aid in indexing, only approved tags are allowed - for a list of approved tags, see [here](<insert link here>). If you would like to propose one or more new tags, you may contact the group admin to do so.

If, during the QC review process, three or more references do not meet the criteria above, your references will not be added and you will be asked to review them yourself to fix and issues before resubmitting them.
